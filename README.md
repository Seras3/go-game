### First code the game, then learn how to play.

⚠️ WARNING : This project involves **AI** and probably you'll lose every match. I'm not risponsible for rage quits.

Run game with: ```python3 main.py```

Base lib: [Python Arcade](https://arcade.academy/) 🐍


*If you are here and wonder why I packed all this in one single file... because that was the requirement for the project.* 🔪🍅
